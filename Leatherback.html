        <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The biggest marine turtle, the Leatherback , is renowned for its distinctive features. They differ from other turtle species in that they have a leathery carapace (shell) as opposed to a hard one. Their carapace is black or dark gray with white or light spot patterns. The typical length and weight of an adult leatherback is 6 to 7 feet (1.8 to 2.1 meters) and 550 to 1,500 pounds (250 to 700 kg), respectively.</p>
   
  
    <h2> Distribution</h2>
    <p>
        There are leatherback turtles all across the world, and they may be found in both tropical and arctic waters. They have a strong tendency to migrate, and some of them may traverse over whole ocean basins. The Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans all contain them.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Feeding Customs</h2>
    <p>Although other soft-bodied animals like salps, tunicates, and squid are occasionally included in the diet of leatherback turtles, jellyfish are their primary source of nutrition. They possess particular adaptations, such as a distinctive jaw structure and a diet heavy in gelatinous prey.</p>
    <h2>Reproduction and Nesting</h2>
    <p>Long migrations are made by leatherback turtles to beaches where they build nests and lay their eggs. Throughout a single nesting season, they have the capacity to build numerous nests. In some areas, leatherbacks engage in a distinctive activity called as "arribada," in which several females arrive at the same time to lay their eggs. From 80 to 120 eggs can be laid in a single clutch. A 60 to 70 day incubation period is typical.</p>
    <h2>Status of Conservation</h2>
    <p>According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), leatherback turtles are considered fragile. Numerous dangers exist for them, including as habitat loss, pollution, climate change, entrapment in fishing gear, and egg theft. Protecting nesting sites, introducing turtle-friendly fishing methods, decreasing marine pollution, and promoting awareness are the main objectives of conservation initiatives.</p>
    <h2>adaptations</h2>
    <p>Leatherbacks possess several unique adaptations that enable them to thrive in marine environments. They have a streamlined body shape, with a large front flippers and a flexible shell, which allows them to swim efficiently. They also have a unique heat-retention ability that helps them maintain a higher body temperature than the surrounding water.</p>
  
     <h2>Lifespan</h2>
     <p> Although the exact length of the leatherback turtle's life is unknown, it is thought that they can survive for several decades. According to some estimations, they can live for up to 40 to 50 years or longer.</p>
