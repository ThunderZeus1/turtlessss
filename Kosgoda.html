            <p>The hatchery's primary goal is to encourage sea turtle conservation. To keep sea turtle eggs safe from both natural predators and human disturbances, the hatchery team retrieves them from shoreline nests that are particularly at risk. The eggs are then placed in artificial nests and incubated there until they hatch. Following hatching, the young turtles are briefly housed in tanks to guarantee their security before being released into the ocean.</p>\

            <h1>Visitor Experience</h1>
            <p>Visitors may see and study sea turtles up close at the hatchery. In addition to learning about the life cycle and conservation activities, visitors may observe the hatching process. The hatchery team also gives educational talks to spread awareness of the value of sea turtle conservation and the dangers that they face.</p>

        <div class="body3">
            <h1>Research and Release</h1>
            <p>Research on sea turtle biology, behavior, and conservation methods is done at the hatchery. They work together with regional and global organizations to disseminate their results and support more extensive sea turtle conservation initiatives. The turtles will eventually be returned to the ocean, where they can help ensure the survival of their species, once they are healthy.</p>

            <h1>Volunteer Opportunities</h1>
            <p>For those who desire to actively contribute to conservation initiatives, the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery provides volunteer opportunities. Volunteers help with a variety of responsibilities, including feeding the turtles, keeping the hatchery clean, and instructing visitors. These initiatives provide participants an opportunity to get their hands dirty while also having an influence on sea turtle conservation.</p>
