  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Large heads and powerful, muscular jaws are characteristics of loggerhead sea turtles. They have a yellowish-brown skin and a reddish-brown carapace (shell). Adults typically weigh between 200 and 400 pounds (90 to 180 kg) and grow to a height of around 3 feet (0.9 meters).
  </p>

  <h2> Distribution</h2>
  <p>
    Located in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, loggerhead sea turtles have a large geographic range. They live around the shore, in places like bays, estuaries, and coral reefs.
  </p>

  <h2>Feeding Customs</h2>
  <p>Although loggerheads are omnivorous, the majority of their food consists of invertebrates that live on the ocean floor, including crabs, mollusks, and sea urchins. They also consume fish, seaweed, and jellyfish.</p>
  <h2>Reproduction and Nesting</h2>
  <p>When it comes time to nest, female loggerhead sea turtles go back to the beaches where they were hatched. They produce clutches of 100 to 126 eggs on average each nest that they excavate in the sand. Hatchlings emerge and travel to the ocean after an incubation period of around 60 days.</p>
  <h2>Status of Conservation</h2>
  <p>Listed as an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), loggerhead sea turtles are marine mammals. They are under danger from a number of factors, such as loss of habitat, pollution, entanglement in fishing gear, and climate change. Protecting nesting areas, enforcing fishing restrictions, and spreading knowledge of the need of conserving their ecosystems are the main objectives of conservation activities.</p>
  <h2>Migration</h2>
  <p>Between their eating and breeding areas, green turtles travel great distances. They are renowned for their prowess in using the Earth's magnetic fields, ocean currents, and other environmental signals to navigate across great oceanic distances.</p>

   <h2>Lifespan</h2>
   <p> Loggerhead sea turtles have a long lifespan, with estimates ranging from 50 to 67 years on average. However, some individuals have been known to live much longer.</p>
